Problem 1: Marathon [Nick Wu, 2014]

Unhappy with the poor health of his cows, Farmer John enrolls them in
an assortment of different physical fitness activities.  His prize cow
Bessie is enrolled in a running class, where she is eventually
expected to run a marathon through the downtown area of the city near
Farmer John's farm!

The marathon course consists of N checkpoints (3 <= N <= 100,000) to
be visited in sequence, where checkpoint 1 is the starting location
and checkpoint N is the finish.  Bessie is supposed to visit all of
these checkpoints one by one, but being the lazy cow she is, she
decides that she will skip up to one checkpoint in order to shorten
her total journey.  She cannot skip checkpoints 1 or N, however, since
that would be too noticeable.

Please help Bessie find the minimum distance that she has to run if
she can skip up to one checkpoint.  

Note that since the course is set in a downtown area with a grid of
streets, the distance between two checkpoints at locations (x1, y1)
and (x2, y2) is given by |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.  This way of measuring
distance -- by the difference in x plus the difference in y -- is
sometimes known as "Manhattan" distance because it reflects the fact
that in a downtown grid, you can travel parallel to the x or y axes,
but you cannot travel along a direct line "as the crow flies".

INPUT: (file marathon.in)

The first line gives the value of N.

The next N lines each contain two space-separated integers, x and y,
representing a checkpoint (-1000 <= x <= 1000, -1000 <= y <= 1000).
The checkpoints are given in the order that they must be visited.
Note that the course might cross over itself several times, with
several checkpoints occurring at the same physical location.  When
Bessie skips such a checkpoint, she only skips one instance of the
checkpoint -- she does not skip every checkpoint occurring at the same
location.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4
0 0
8 3
11 -1
10 0

OUTPUT: (file marathon.out)

Output the minimum distance that Bessie can run by skipping up to one
checkpoint.  Don't forget to end your output with a newline.  In the
sample case shown here, skipping the checkpoint at (8, 3) leads to the
minimum total distance of 14.

Problem 2: Crosswords [Mark Gordon, 2014]

Like all cows, Bessie the cow likes to solve crossword puzzles.
Unfortunately, her sister Elsie has spilled milk all over her book of
crosswords, smearing the text and making it difficult for her to see
where each clue begins.  It's your job to help Bessie out and recover
the clue numbering!

An unlabeled crossword is given to you as an N by M grid (3 <= N <=
50, 3 <= M <= 50).  Some cells will be clear (typically colored white)
and some cells will be blocked (typically colored black). Given this
layout, clue numbering is a simple process which follows two logical
steps:

Step 1: We determine if a each cell begins a horizontal or vertical
clue.  If a cell begins a horizontal clue, it must be clear, its
neighboring cell to the left must be blocked or outside the crossword
grid, and the two cells on its right must be clear (that is, a
horizontal clue can only represent a word of 3 or more characters).
The rules for a cell beginning a vertical clue are analogous: the cell
above must be blocked or outside the grid, and the two cells below
must be clear.

Step 2: We assign a number to each cell that begins a clue.  Cells are
assigned numbers sequentially starting with 1 in the same order that
you would read a book; cells in the top row are assigned numbers from
left to right, then the second row, etc.  Only cells beginning a clue
are assigned numbers.

For example, consider the grid, where '.' indicates a clear cell and
'#' a blocked cell.

...
#..
...
..#
.##

Cells that can begin a horizontal or vertical clue are marked with !
below:

!!!
#..
!..
..#
.##

If we assign numbers to these cells, we get the following;

123
#..
4..
..#
.##

Note that crossword described in the input data may not satisfy
constraints typically seen in published crosswords.  For example, some
clear cells may not be part of any clue.

INPUT: (file crosswords.in)

The first line of input contains N and M separated by a space.

The next N lines of input each describe a row of the grid.  Each
contains M characters, which are either '.' (a clear cell) or '#' (a
blocked cell).

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 3
...
#..
...
..#
.##

OUTPUT: (file crosswords.out)

On the first line of output, print the number of clues.

On the each remaining line, print the row and column giving the
position of a single clue (ordered as described above).  The top left
cell has position (1, 1).  The bottom right cell has position (N, M).

Problem 3: Cow Jog [Mark Gordon, 2014]

The cows are out exercising their hooves again!  There are N cows
jogging on an infinitely-long single-lane track (1 <= N <= 100,000).
Each cow starts at a distinct position on the track, and some cows jog
at different speeds.

With only one lane in the track, cows cannot pass each other.  When a
faster cow catches up to another cow, she has to slow down to avoid
running into the other cow, becoming part of the same running group.

Eventually, no more cows will run into each other.  Farmer John
wonders how many groups will be left when this happens.  Please help
him compute this number.

INPUT: (file cowjog.in)

The first line of input contains the integer N.

The following N lines each contain the initial position and speed of a
single cow.  Position is a nonnegative integer and speed is a positive
integer; both numbers are at most 1 billion.  All cows start at 
distinct positions, and these will be given in increasing order in
the input.

Problem 4: Learning by Example [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John has been reading all about the exciting field of machine
learning, where one can learn interesting and sometimes unexpected
patterns by analyzing large data (he has even started calling one of
the fields on his farm the "field of machine learning"!).  FJ decides
to use data about his existing cow herd to build an automatic
classifier that can guess whether a cow will have spots or not.

Unfortunately, FJ hasn't been very good at keeping track of data about
his cows.  For each of his N cows (1 <= N <= 50,000), all he knows is
the weight of the cow, and whether the cow has spots.  Each of his
cows has a distinct weight.  Given this data, he builds what is called
a "nearest neighbor classifier".  To guess whether a new cow C will
have spots or not, FJ first finds the cow C' in his herd with weight
closest to that of C.  If C' has spots, then FJ guesses that C will
also have spots; if C' has no spots, FJ guesses the same for C.  If
there is not one unique nearest neighbor C' but rather a tie between
two of FJ's cows, then FJ guesses that C will have spots if one or
both these nearest neighbors has spots.

FJ wants to test his new automatic spot predictor on a group of new
cows that are just arriving at his farm.  After weighing these cows,
he sees that the new shipment of cows contains a cow of every integer
weight between A and B (inclusive).  Please determine how many of
these cows will be classified as having spots, using FJ's new
classifier.  Note that the classifier only makes decisions using data
from FJ's N existing cows, not any of the new cows.  Also note that
since A and B can both be quite large, your program will not likely
run fast enough if it loops from A to B counting by ones.

INPUT: (file learning.in) 

The first line of the input contains three integers N, A, and B
(1 <= A <= B <= 1,000,000,000).

The next N lines each describe a single cow.  Each line contains
either S W, indicating a spotted cow of weight W, or NS W, indicating
a non-spotted cow of weight W.  Weights are all integers in the range
1 ... 1,000,000,000. 

SAMPLE INPUT:

OUTPUT: (file learning.out)

A single integer giving the number of incoming cows that FJ's
algorithm will classify as having spots.  In the example shown

will all be classified as having spots.

Problem 1: Piggy Back [Brian Dean, 2014]

Bessie and her sister Elsie graze in different fields during the day,
and in the evening they both want to walk back to the barn to rest.
Being clever bovines, they come up with a plan to minimize the total
amount of energy they both spend while walking.

Bessie spends B units of energy when walking from a field to an
adjacent field, and Elsie spends E units of energy when she walks to
an adjacent field.  However, if Bessie and Elsie are together in the
same field, Bessie can carry Elsie on her shoulders and both can move
to an adjacent field while spending only P units of energy (where P
might be considerably less than B+E, the amount Bessie and Elsie would
have spent individually walking to the adjacent field).  If P is very
small, the most energy-efficient solution may involve Bessie and Elsie
traveling to a common meeting field, then traveling together piggyback
for the rest of the journey to the barn.  Of course, if P is large, it
may still make the most sense for Bessie and Elsie to travel
separately.  On a side note, Bessie and Elsie are both unhappy with
the term "piggyback", as they don't see why the pigs on the farm
should deserve all the credit for this remarkable form of
transportation.

Given B, E, and P, as well as the layout of the farm, please compute
the minimum amount of energy required for Bessie and Elsie to reach
the barn.

INPUT: (file piggyback.in)

The first line of input contains the positive integers B, E, P, N, and
M.  All of these are at most 40,000.  B, E, and P are described above.
N is the number of fields in the farm (numbered 1..N, where N >= 3),
and M is the number of connections between fields.  Bessie and Elsie
start in fields 1 and 2, respectively.  The barn resides in field N.

The next M lines in the input each describe a connection between a
pair of different fields, specified by the integer indices of the two
fields.  Connections are bi-directional.  It is always possible to
travel from field 1 to field N, and field 2 to field N, along a series
of such connections.
